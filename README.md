# Weather Data Service - Enhanced with Godspeed Framework

## Overview
Welcome to the Weather Data Service project, now reimagined with the Godspeed framework! This application, initially built using Node.js and Express, now integrates the cutting-edge Godspeed framework, enhancing its capabilities in handling and responding to weather-related data requests. Utilizing Axios for HTTP requests and YAML for configuration, the service is more robust and efficient within the Godspeed ecosystem.

## Features
- **Godspeed Framework Integration**: Incorporates the Godspeed framework for improved performance and scalability.
- **Weather API Integration**: Leverages Axios to connect to various weather APIs, now managed through Godspeed's efficient backend handling.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Employs Express and Godspeed's powerful event-handling features for processing weather data requests.
- **Declarative Configuration**: Configuration is more streamlined and intuitive with YAML files, fully compatible with Godspeed's configuration standards.

## Getting Started with Godspeed

### Prerequisites
- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- Godspeed framework ([Installation Guide](https://godspeedframework.io/installation))

### Installation
1. Clone the Godspeed-enhanced repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Kill-Switch-OP/HTM4-Weather
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd weather-data-service-godspeed
   ```
3. Install the dependencies, including Godspeed:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

### Configuration
- Configure your service using Godspeed's intuitive setup. Modify the `.env`, `datasources.yaml`, `events.yaml`, `eventsources.yaml`, and `functions.yaml` files to fit your project needs.
- Set up Godspeed-specific environment variables for optimal performance and security.

### Running the Application with Godspeed
To launch the service with Godspeed enhancements:
```
npm run godspeed-start
```
The server will initialize with Godspeed's advanced runtime environment on port 3000.

## Usage
Interact with the service at `localhost:3000/weather`. Thanks to Godspeed, you'll experience faster responses and more efficient data handling. Customize response formats and structures in the YAML configuration files, now optimized for Godspeed's framework.
